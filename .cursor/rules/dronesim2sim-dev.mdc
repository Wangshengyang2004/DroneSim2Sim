# Dev Rule
By default we use pytorch to complete the core logic, if using jax, the file should end with _jax to distinguish.

# Run in the terminal
Since we use uv to develop the repo, please make sure the venv is activated already.

# Core logic
All core logic and things can be abstracted should be put in the core folder. For these simulators, keep minimal to build.

# No numpy
For compatibility, use all torch, or jax for _jax. No numpy in the loop.
